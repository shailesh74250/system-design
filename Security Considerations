Securing your notification service is paramount to protect user data and maintain system integrity.

Protect Sensitive Data
- Encryption: Encrypt data such as user contact information in the database.
- Secure Storage: Use environment variables or secret management tools for storing API keys and credentials.

Validate Inputs
- Sanitize Inputs: Prevent injection attacks by validating and sanitizing all incoming data.
- Use Validation Libraries: Implement libraries like Joi or class-validator to enforce data schemas.

Rate Limiting
- Prevent Abuse: Implement rate limiting to protect against spamming or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

const limiter = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
    message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.',
});

app.use('/notifications', limiter);

Secure APIs
- Authentication: Require authentication tokens (e.g., JWT) for accessing notification endpoints.
- Authorization: Ensure that only authorized users or services can send notifications.

Audit and Logging
- Comprehensive Logging: Log all critical actions, including notification sends, failures, and retries.
- Audit Trails: Maintain records for compliance and forensic analysis.
