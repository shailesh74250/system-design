Ensuring your notification service performs well under varying loads is essential for maintaining user trust and satisfaction.

Monitoring Metrics
- Delivery Rates: Track the number of successfully delivered notifications versus failures.
- Latency: Measure the time taken from notification creation to delivery.
- Queue Lengths: Monitor the size of message queues to anticipate scaling needs.
- Error Rates: Keep an eye on the frequency and types of errors occurring.
- Throughput: Assess how many notifications are processed per second/minute.

Scaling Strategies
- Horizontal Scaling: Add more instances of notification workers to handle increased load.
- Auto-Scaling: Use cloud services that automatically adjust the number of workers based on metrics.
- Load Balancing: Distribute incoming messages evenly across multiple workers.

Alerting
- Set Up Alerts: Configure alerts for critical metrics like high error rates or queue lengths.
- Use Tools: Integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or New Relic.
