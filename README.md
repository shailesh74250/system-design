Helmet.js is a widely-used middleware for Express.js and other Node.js web frameworks that helps secure your applications by setting various HTTP headers. By default, Helmet sets a collection of security-related headers to protect your app from common vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other malicious attacks. Implementing Helmet is a straightforward way to enhance the security posture of your Node.js applications.
