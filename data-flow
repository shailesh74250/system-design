5. Data Flow
Understanding the data flow through the system helps in identifying potential bottlenecks and ensuring data integrity.

Example Workflow: User Registration

Client Request: User submits the registration form via the frontend application.
API Gateway: Receives the request, performs initial validation, authentication (if applicable), and routes it to the User Service.
User Service: Processes the registration by:
Validating input data.
Checking for existing users.
Creating a new user record in the User Database.
Search Service: Indexes the new user profile in the Search Engine for future search queries.
Notification Service: Sends a welcome email or SMS to the user.
Response: The User Service sends a success response back through the API Gateway to the client.
Logging and Monitoring: All actions are logged, and relevant metrics are updated in real-time dashboards.
