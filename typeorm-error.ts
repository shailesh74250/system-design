// TypeORM-Specific Error Handling
/*
TypeORM is a powerful ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript that facilitates interactions with databases. However, database operations can fail for various reasons, such as constraint violations, connection issues, or query syntax errors. Efficiently handling these errors is crucial.

Common TypeORM Errors
1. EntityNotFoundError: Thrown when an entity is not found.
3. QueryFailedError: Thrown for failed queries, such as constraint violations.
3. TransactionErrors: Errors that occur during transactional operations.
4. ConnectionError: Issues establishing a connection to the database.

// Handling TypeORM Errors

try {
    const user = await userRepository.findOneOrFail(id);
} catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof EntityNotFoundError) {
        // Handle entity not found
    } else {
        // Handle other errors
    }
}
