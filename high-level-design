High-Level Architecture
A Microservices-based Architecture
1. Client Layer
   Web browsers and mobile applications
2. API Gateway
  Act as a single entry point, handling request routing, authentication, rate limitting, and loading balancing.
3. Microservice Layer
  Various independent services such as User-service, serach-servicen messaging-service, payment-service.
4. Data Layer
  Databases, Caching System, and Search Engines.
5. Infrastrure Layer
  Cloud services, container orchestration (eg, Kubernetes) CI/CD pipelines
6. Auxiliary Services
  Logging, monitoring, notification systems.
