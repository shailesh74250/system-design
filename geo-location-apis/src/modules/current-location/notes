Objective: When a user opens the app, the geolocation API is used to detect their current location.
API Used: Browser Geolocation API (for web apps) or device-specific APIs (like Androidâ€™s Fused Location Provider).
Example: Uber uses the current location to show nearby drivers and calculate the estimated time of arrival (ETA).

We can use navigator object in js to find out correct coordinates
Geolocation API
Note: Geolocation is most accurate for devices with GPS, like smartphones.
Note: As of Chrome 50, the Geolocation API will only work on secure contexts such as HTTPS. If your site is hosted on an non-secure origin (such as HTTP) the requests to get the users location will no longer function.
